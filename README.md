Rascal, n: Synonym for rogue.

Rascal is a very simple roguelike game. I like to re-implement it in
different languages, as an exercise in learning a new language more
deeply.

This is the go version.

BUILD & INSTALL

 * Install go 1.3 on your system.
 * Get a source checkout; set GOPATH to that folder.
